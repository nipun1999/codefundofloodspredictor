### Urban Flood PPM as an Application Utility

>* Urban Flooding in unplanned city areas has grown to be a big menace for the residents.
>* Imagine going to work in the morning only to be stopped by regions overflowing with water and vehicles unable to move.
>* The application aims to provide users with real time flooding information, to alert them if their route is workable. 

#### Predicting Model:
>* Designating flood prone areas by calculating low lying areas using Digital Elevation Model data and employing historical data of the locations of urban floods(We plan on collecting this using user inputs).
>* The areas will be triggered on the map to show flooding in specific areas after a certain threshold of rainfall occurs. 
>* As the model might not be accurate this will be supported by user inputs. Any user can mark certain area to be flooded and inaccessible.

#### Management Tab:
>* Flood Zones based on the intensity of floods predicted through our model and live data given by the user.
>* Notification: If a new flood zone is triggered in his/her city, then a notification will be dropped regarding the location of flood area. 
>* Relief Center : Proper marking of  nearby Relief Center on the Map when large scale flood zone is triggered.

#### Prevention Tab:
>* The municipal corporations will be provided with a extra tab on the application.
>* The map here will display the flood prone areas decided decided through our data provided by the user. 
>* This will help the MC to identify areas with bad sewage management.

#### Salient Features:
